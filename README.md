You are interested in designing and building your own tube kite? But you don't know how to start?
Where to get the plans and the right materials?  
Then you should join this Open Kite Build project!

## Getting started

Start with the Kite [Teaser](https://github.com/wingworks/kite-teaser)

## First steps

1. Take a look at the kite design parameters and the 3D model of the kite to get an idea of the design  
1. Read the step by step instructions in the project wiki (not published yet)
1. Study the DXF kite plan 

## Prerequisities

Recommended Software:
- CAD Software (e.g. [QCAD](http://www.qcad.org)) to open and edit the DXF plans
- Open Source Software [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to view the 3D kite model

## Material
For best performance and comparablity it is very important to use proper materials to build the kite. Thanks to our partner [extremtextil.de](http://extremtextil.de) you can get all required fabrics in high quality and different colors online.

**Polyester Dacron**

Dacron is used for the leading edge, struts and to reinforce the sail
* [Dimension Polyant 170g/sqm Dacron](http://www.extremtextil.de/catalog/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=dacron&x=10&y=11)

**Kite Polyester Spinnaker**

Polyester spinnaker fabrics rely on their tight Polyester yarn to resits stretch. In comparison to nylon fabrics they do not change their characteristics when exposed to water and sun.

**TPU**

TPU is used for the leading edge and strut bladders
* [TPU for Kite Bladders](http://www.extremtextil.de/catalog/TPU-film-transparent-0-1mm-thick-110g-sqm-for-Kite-Bladder::2801.html)

You can also get 'ready to install' bladders for the GO from [bonobo repair](http://bonoborepair.de/de/Kite-Bladder/).

**Kite recycling**

If you have an old kite in a very good condition and don't mind the extra work for cutting and sewing the GO panels out of several pieces then you can 'upcycle' your old kite.
Remove all seams and use the same fabric orientation.

## HowTo sew the kite

There will be a howto coming soon on the wiki. Until then please refer to the [wingworks kite sewing manual](http://www.wingworks.de/bauanleitungen/tube-kite/bauanleitung/) (german only)

## Kite design software

![WingCalc Kite Software](http://www.wingworks.de/wp-content/uploads/wingcalc_kite_software-2-300x169.png)

To create the 3D Model of the kite and the dxf plans I'm using my software [WingCalc](http://www.wingworks.de/kite-design/3d-software-wingcalc/). The software is not part of the project and not (yet) OpenSource. I'm also working on an onlineversion to make it available for everyone.
